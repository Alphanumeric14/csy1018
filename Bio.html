      <p>This is Kritagya Jung Adhikari working with a project highlighting the basics of html and css world. At first, let me start with my geographical details.
         I was born on 17th of July, 1998 in a country where citizens are called Nepalese. Getting more into it, a beautiful town Dharan was my region of birth.
         From a very tender age, I had a sort of interest in a stuffs that were imaginative and surreal. Music was a kind of taste I really had much preferences to.
         I used to loathe schooling more than much. I never had much interest in academic studies but I made my way to high school and that's a remarkable step in my
         life. Science was a thing I really loved since childhood. Research related to science thing were always on my mind.</p> <!--defines a paragraph-->
      <p> Talking about hobbies, I am really fond of striking the ball with a bat and vice versa, soccers were a kind of dream during a growing age.
         Perhaps, most of the time in my life is well-utilized in musical way. </p>
      <br> Guess it's an end to a short bio. The project is really skill-builder and makes scholars utilize mind jobs with a sharp edge. <!--breaks line-->
